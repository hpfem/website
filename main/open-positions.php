<h1>Jobs</h1>

<h3>WebGL 3D Geometry Modeling</h3>

<p>
WebGL is an essential component in the Online Lab but we still define 
3D surfaces via elementary surface triangles. We need to be able to 
define 3D geometries easier, similarly to commercial softwares such as
Inventor or Solid Edge.
</p>

<h3>Create Admin Interface to the Online Lab</h3>

<p>
We need a Django-based admin interface that will allow us to monitor
how many people are logged in to the Online Lab, how much CPU they are 
using, how much memory, how much hard disk space they are using, etc.
We also need to access statistics such as how many worksheets we have, 
how many user accounts, how is the traffic during the last hour/day/week/month,
etc. We also need to set CPU time and memory limits, and enforce them.
</p>

<h3>Improve the Structure of Published Worksheets</h3>

<p>
The number of published worksheets is growing and thus we need to split them into 
thematic groups. The user should be able to choose for his/her worksheet tags 
from predefined keywords, or create own keywords. Search should be enabled 
by "author" and by "keyword".
</p>

<h3>Make Online Lab work natively on Android</h3>

<p>
Currently, the Online Lab will work there just in a web browser mode, 
but the user experience can be improved dramatically by creating a native
version for Android. 
</p>


<h3>Implement Javascript GUIs for engineering and scientific applications</h3>

<p>
We need to implement Javascript GUIs similar to <a href="http://hpfem.org/agros2d">Agros2D</a>
(see sample screenshot <a href="http://hpfem.org/agros2d/images/ubuntu-motor.png">here</a>) 
and make them run in the Online Lab. The Javascript GUIs do not need to 
be this general, we would rather prefer to have many simple GUIs that are designed 
to handle smaller model classes. They need to be easily customizable.
</p>


<h3>Implement Robot Karel in Javascript</h3>

<p>
This is a great tool to teach programming to kids. 
See its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%28programming_language%29">Wikipedia page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Implement Graphical Calculus Applications in Javascript</h3>

<p>
Tons of them are already available, often as Java applets. 
We want to have all of them in the Online Lab, equally interactive and possibly nicer. 
See for example <a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/dlittle/java/calculus/index.html">this page</a>,
<a href="http://calculusapplets.com/">this page</a>, or
<a href="http://www.slu.edu/classes/maymk/MathApplets-SLU.html">this page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Make Free Logical/Puzzle Games Part of the Online Lab</h3>

<p>
We are interested in these games to make the Online Lab more 
interesting to kids, and to help develop their logical thinking. 
Many of such games are available at 
<a href="http://www.freegamesforyourwebsite.com/tag/puzzle_games">FreeGamesForYourWebsite</a>,
<a href="http://www.agame.com/games/barrel_moving/barrel_moving.html">aGames</a>, 
<a href="http://www.freegamesjungle.com">FreeGamesJungle</a> and elsewhere on the web.
An example of embedding a (not very logical) game into your own web page is 
<a href="http://hpfem.org/~pavel/games.html">here</a>.

</p>

<h3>There is More</h3>

<p>
The above list is updated from time to time while our projects 
are moving forward fast. If you are interested in scientific 
computing, computer graphics or similar, we probably have 
something for you.
</p>

<h1>Open Positions</h1>

We usually have open positions for undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. students 
to work with our team at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). UNR is a great place 
to work and Reno is a great place to live. We like efficiency. Therefore, without 
exceptions, our prospective students must work with the team for some time and 
accomplish something. We are interested in computer science, engineering, math, 
and other majors.
