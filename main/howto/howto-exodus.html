<h2>Hermes - Exodus and NetCDF HowTo</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>How to install ExoduxII and NetCDF libraries<br>
       (necessary to read Cubit files in Hermes)</b><br>

For system-wide installation do (as a root):<br>

1) cd /<br>
2)<br>
64 bit:
<br>
wget http://hpfem.org/downloads/exodusii-bin-amd64-4.81.tar.gz<br>
wget http://hpfem.org/downloads/netcdf-bin-amd64-4.0.1.tar.gz<br>
<br>
32 bit:<br>
wget http://hpfem.org/downloads/exodusii-bin-i686-4.81.tar.gz<br>
wget http://hpfem.org/downloads/netcdf-bin-i686-4.0.1.tar.gz<br>
<br>
3)<br> 
tar xvzf exodusii-bin-*.tar.gz<br>
tar xvzf netcdf-bin-*.tar.gz<br>
4) <br>
rm exodusii-bin-*.tar.gz<br>
rm netcdf-bin-*.tar.gz<br>
<br>
This will unpack binary packages of netcdf and exodusii in to /opt/packages/netcdf <br>
and /opt/packages/exodusii, respectively. If you do not like the location you can <br>
change it to whatever you like, but you need to adjust the CMake variables accordingly <br>
(see below).<br>

<p>
<b>To use exodusii support in Hermes2D:</b><br>

- clone the repo (is you have done it yet)<br>
- in CMake.vars, say:<br>
 SET(WITH_EXODUSII YES)<br>
 SET(EXODUSII_ROOT /opt/packages/exodusii)<br>
 SET(NETCDF_ROOT   /opt/packages/netcdf)<br>
<br>
cmake .<br>
make<br>
<br>
Note: the binary packages were prepared on Ubuntu 9.10 (64 bit and 32 bit). <br>
They might work on other 64 and 32 bit machines, but we did not test that. <br>
However, you can always build these packages by yourself if you are <br>
on a different architecture (both are available for free).
