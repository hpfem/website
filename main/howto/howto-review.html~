<h2>Hermes - How To Review Patches</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The patch has to be downloaded, applied, and the code tested, that it builds.
</li>
<li>
All tests must pass
</li>
<li>
Then you have to look at the patch itself and see if you agree with the changes. This means:
<ul>
<li>
you think that it will not break anything in the future
</li>
<li>
it is well documented what it does
</li>
<li>
there are tests for the new functionality <b>(important!)</b>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Then you have to use your judgment and say what you think about it, and give it +1, or -1.
</li>
</ul>
